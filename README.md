# archive_crawler
Crawl the archive, create standardized metadata from existing documents, and ingest it into MongoDB.

Setup / Run Environment

The archive crawler requires that three other JAX github repositories be installed in a virtual environment. These are the [system_groups_finder](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/system_groups_finder), the [meta_mapper](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/meta_mapper), and the [metadata_mongo_ingester](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/metadata_mongo_ingester).
